## 🚀 How to Contribute

Adding your name is a super simple and fun way to learn (or practice) the **Git + GitHub** workflow.

Follow these easy steps:

---

### 🪞 1. Fork the Repository

1. Go to the **[terenaam repository on GitHub](https://github.com/sidbabua/terenaam)**
2. Click the **"Fork"** button at the top-right.  
   This creates a copy of the repo under your GitHub account.

---

### 💻 2. Clone Your Fork

Now, bring that fork down to your computer.

1. On your fork’s page, click the **“Code”** button.
2. Copy the repository URL (HTTPS works best).
3. Open your **terminal** (or Git Bash / Command Prompt) and run:

   ```bash
   git clone [THE_URL_YOU_COPIED]
   ```

4. Move into the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd terenaam
   ```

---

### 📝 3. Create and Edit Your Name File

Let’s make your mark in history!

1. Copy the sample file:
   ```bash
   cp Sid.txt [Yourname].txt
   ```
   Replace `[Yourname].txt` with your actual name — for example:
   ```bash
   cp Sid.txt Priyansu.txt
   ```
2. Open your new file (`[Yourname].txt`) in your favorite text editor.
3. Change the contents — replace "Sid" with **your own name**.

---

### 📦 4. Commit Your Changes

1. Stage your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
2. Commit with a clear and friendly message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "[Yourname] commit"
   ```

---

### 🌍 5. Push Your Commit

Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:

```bash
git push
```

---

### 🔁 6. Open a Pull Request

Now the fun part!

1. Go back to your fork on GitHub.  
   You’ll see something like:

   > “This branch is X commits ahead of terenaam:main.”

2. Click **“Contribute” → “Open pull request”**.
3. Use a short and clear title like:
   ```
   [Your Name] Pull Request
   ```
4. Click **“Create pull request”**.

---

### 🎉 That’s It!

Once your pull request is reviewed and merged,  
your name will live forever in the **Hall of Names**. 😎

**Made with ❤️ for the open-source community.**
